/** \page example Examples
You can refer to the below stated example applications for more details on how to use TRNGPSV driver in various modes. All the examples are in polled mode as this driver uses no interrupts.

@section ex1 xtrngpsv_drng_example.c
Contains an example on how to use the XTrngpsv driver directly.
This example demonstrates use of instantiate, reseed, generate functionalities while generating random number using DRNG mode.

For details, see xtrngpsv_drng_example.c.

@section ex2 xtrngpsv_drng_df_example.c
Contains an example on how to use the XTrng driver directly.
This example demonstrates use of instantiate, reseed, generate functionalities while generating random number using DRNG mode, with Derivative Function (DF).

For details, see xtrngpsv_drng_df_example.c.

@section ex3 xtrngpsv_ptrng_example.c
Contains an example on how to use the XTrngpsv driver directly.
This example demonstrates use of instantiate, generate functionalities while generating random number using PTRNG mode.

For details, see xtrngpsv_ptrng_example.c.

@section ex4 xtrngpsv_ptrng_df_example.c
Contains an example on how to use the XTrng driver directly.
This example demonstrates use of instantiate, generate functionalities while generating random number using PTRNG mode, with Derivative Function (DF).

For details, see xtrngpsv_ptrng_df_example.c.

@section ex5 xtrngpsv_hrng_example.c
Contains an example on how to use the XTrngpsv driver directly.
This example demonstrates use of instantiate, reseed, generate functionalities while generating random number using HRNG mode.

For details, see xtrngpsv_hrng_example.c.

@section ex6 xtrngpsv_hrng_df_example.c
Contains an example on how to use the XTrng driver directly.
This example demonstrates use of instantiate, reseed, generate functionalities while generating random number using HRNG mode, with Derivative Function (DF).
